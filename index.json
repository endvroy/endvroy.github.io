Stochastic superiotimization uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample to program space, using a cost function to guide the sampling process. Human Resource Machine is a game about assembly programming. The architecture operates with one-address code, only one register, one input/output stream and limited memory. The project is efficiently implemented in Rust.\n","date":1461740400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461740400,"objectID":"9bf2da6304e9398be49d6e492cb88b45","permalink":"/project/stoke/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/stoke/","section":"project","summary":"[Stochastic superoptimization](http://stoke.stanford.edu/) for the [Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) architecture.","tags":[],"title":"STOKE for HRM","type":"project"}]
